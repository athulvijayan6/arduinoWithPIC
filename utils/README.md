This library is a part of a goal of making an easy, ergonomic API for using 
PIC Micrcontrollers. The aim of such aproject is to make libraries which are bug-free
so that others doesn't need to go through the scary job of working with all the registers  

Since Arduino is already famous for its simplicity, We can mimic functions in arduino
so that it will remove lot of confusion to users.

Utils contains the general and basic functions like I/O, bit operations etc..

utils.h
utils.c
are the livrary files.

main.c is a program i used to test the functions. So does not required for library operation.
